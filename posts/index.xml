      <description>I have configured some pipelines before but not a Travis one. It was pretty straigh forward to do. I have learned that configuring a pipeline is easy and hard at the same time. It is possible to get something done extremely fast (80%) but that it is extremely hard to get it to do the things it does correctly (20%). The most fun part was to make the pipeline to deploy this page over and over again and iron out the small errors I made in the configurations.</description>

      <description>I stumbled upon this course in WebOodi and decided immediatelly to take it. The fact that this course is offered as a web course was great. I can do the needed work at my own discretion.
 I wanted to get some new angles and ideas on pipelines. I haven&amp;rsquo;t used Travis previously so now I have.
 This Hugo contraption is totally new to me and seems a little strange but with a little time I believe this would become second nature to me.</description>
