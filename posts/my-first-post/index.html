What I have previously done is to write almost everything from scratch which is not really smart. As the frameworks really do speed up the work.,In general it is a very good idea to spread these frameworks and ideas all over the courses in bits and pieces and let the information sink in slowly.,DevOps is extremely important part of developing. We developers are and should be lazy.

The commits are or atleast should be visible to the whole development team and managers at will and we as a whole will produce better quality.,Also using Git is a breath of fresh air from work with centralized version control.,The webpage is probably a good fit for such small project.
