      <description>I stumbled upon this course in WebOodi and decided immediatelly to take it. The fact that this course is offered as a web course was great. I can do the needed work at my own discretion.
 I wanted to get some new angles and ideas on pipelines. I haven&amp;rsquo;t used Travis previously so now I have.
 This Hugo contraption is totally new to me and seems a little strange but with a little time I believe this would become second nature to me.</description>
