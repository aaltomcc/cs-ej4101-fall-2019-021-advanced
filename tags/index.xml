      <title> DevOps for one makes all of these visible to other developers and managers. The commits are or atleast should be visible to the whole development team and managers at will and we as a whole will produce better quality.</title>

      <title> I have very little experience with such site generators so this is something new to discover. What I have previously done is to write almost everything from scratch which is not really smart. As the frameworks really do speed up the work.</title>

      <title>DevOps is extremely important part of developing. We developers are and should be lazy. We tend to insert **Tatti Mansikka** and other stupid test values in our databases, code and tests and are not really held accountable on such stupidity.</title>

      <title>I have configured some pipelines before but not a Travis one. I found it to be very similar than the one in Azure Devopes.</title>

      <title>I stumbled upon this course in WebOodi and decided immediatelly to take it. The fact that this course is offered as a web course was great. I can do the needed work at my own discretion.</title>

      <title>In general it is a very good idea to spread these frameworks and ideas all over the courses in bits and pieces and let the information sink in slowly.</title>

      <title>The webpage is probably a good fit for such small project. I would have liked to implement a pipeline to run a batch of tests in a Docker container but maybe this is something we will be doing at work or on other courses inevitably?</title>

      <title>This Hugo contraption is totally new to me and seems a little strange but with a little time I believe this would become second nature to me.</title>
