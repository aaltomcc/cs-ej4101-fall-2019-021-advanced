I like coding. I like it alot.

My current occupation as a software developer allows me to do just that. I work mainly on backend and other non front end stuff. Languages I use frequently are SQL, C#, JavaScript, Typescript, Scala etc. As much as I detest writing tests I do find that they are a necessity. So Xunit, Robot framework and other testing frameworks are also a frequent tool I use.

I am not as meticulous as I would like to be so running the tests really helps me find my own errors faster.

As hobbies go this is it. My current hobby is to finish my second degree here at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en) majoring in [CS](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science).

```xml
<root>
    <body>
        <Content1>This is XML</Content1>
        <Content2>It seems to be overly noisy way of transmitting</Content2>

            <Content31>data</Content31>
            <Content32>accross</Content32>

```

```json
{
    "root": {
        "Body" : {
            "Content1": "This is JSON",
            "Content2": "The noise level is no where near as high as with XML.",
            "Content3": {
                "Content31": "Of course this also has some noise but",
                "Content32": "not", 
                "Content33": "the ridiculous amount that is present in the XML.",
            }
        }
    }
}
