* I have configured some pipelines before but not a Travis one. It was pretty straigh forward to do.
* I have learned that configuring a pipeline is easy and hard at the same time. It is possible to get **something** done extremely fast (80%) but that it is extremely hard to get it to do the things it does correctly (20%).
* The most fun part was to make the pipeline to deploy this page over and over again and iron out the small errors I made in the configurations.
* As I dug around on the removal of the date I stumbled accross someone askind almost the same thing in [GitHub](https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke/issues/85). There is a link to a page using the theme. In the Issue discussion the original developer pretty much smokes the developer who wrote the tutorial for one line sentence where he/she says that the date show/no show error is related to the theme.
* The concepts covered were pretty much known to me before hand (except Hugo) and this was just a way to verify previously gathered information and see If I can make it.
* The most difficult part was to write these 250-500 word long learning diary thingys to this page.
* The pipeline was easy to me as was the Git and GitHub usage.
* I don't know if the course has some way of logging the branches and commits but I faked my history and rebased the commits to one single happy commit where everything just works. This is something I don't like but will keep on doing to make the history more presentable.
